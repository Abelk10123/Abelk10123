# Hi, I’m Abel 👋

- Computer Science student @ University of Nottingham (2nd Year)
- Studying abroad in China (Spring Semester 2025)
- Interests: Tech Sales · Sales Engineering · IT · Software Development · Sales Development

## What I Do
- Build small but effective demo and coursework projects with clear scope and documentation
- Focus on maintainable code, testing, and incremental improvement
- Learn tools and concepts that connect technical implementation with business value
  
## Achievements
- Achieved a **2:1 (Second Class)** in first-year Computer Science at the University of Nottingham
  
## Featured Projects

### Cyborg Platformer (Java) — COMP2013: Developing Maintainable Software
A 2D platform game developed across multiple coursework milestones, with emphasis on **software maintenance, refactoring, testing, and controlled evolution** rather than raw feature count.

**Key focus areas**
- Migration from a legacy Swing-based implementation to a JavaFX MVC architecture
- Preservation of legacy behaviour via a Swing–JavaFX bridge
- Incremental refactoring guided by SOLID, DRY, and KISS principles
- Unit and integration testing under headless CI constraints

**Version 3 evolution highlights**
- JavaFX start menu with scene-based navigation
- Pause overlay that safely suspends the game loop
- Centralised scoring and reward logic in the model layer
- Restored legacy ammunition reward behaviour without regression
- Improved test stability via headless-safe entity initialisation

**Tech**
- Java 17, JavaFX
- JUnit 5, Maven
- Git / GitHub

### Operating Systems & Concurrency Simulator — COMP2007
A C-based operating system simulator implementing core concurrency, scheduling, and synchronisation concepts.

**Implemented components**
- Thread-safe non-blocking and blocking queues
- CPU and environment threads
- Process lifecycle management
- Event-driven scheduling simulation
- Deterministic logging and testing under concurrency

**Key concepts**
- POSIX threads
- Synchronisation primitives
- Producer–consumer patterns
- Safe memory management
- Deterministic testing of concurrent systems

### Reversi (Java)
University project implementing a full Othello/Reversi board game with optional AI opponents.

**Features**
- Move validation and disc-flipping logic
- Score tracking and turn-based game loop
- Simple AI and greedy AI (maximising immediate gain)

**Tech**
- Java
- Object-oriented design

### SaaS Quote Calculator (Python)
A lightweight command-line tool demonstrating practical business logic applied through code.

**Features**
- Dependency-free Python script
- Accepts inputs such as seat count and list price
- Applies tiered volume discounts
- Outputs subtotal and final pricing breakdown

**Tech**
- Python 3
- WSL2 (Ubuntu)

## Skills
- Java & C (university coursework)
- Python (data scripts, small utilities)
- Node.js & React (personal projects)
- Git & GitHub workflows
- Writing technical documentation and testable code

## Goals
Looking for internships in **tech sales, sales engineering, or IT** where I can demonstrate:
- Clear technical communication
- Practical demos and prototypes
- Clean, well-documented implementations
